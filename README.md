We were given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election by the Colorado Board of Elections employee.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. The voter turnout for each county
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. The county with the highest turnout

## Resources

## Election-Audit Summary
This code script can be used for any other election just because it wasn't hard coded. Therefore, it becomes easier to use it for other elections. We may need to add few modifications to adapt this code for another elections. Some of the modifications we can add could be:
- The name of the csv excel file where the original data is stored;
- The indexing to access the data in the list because that depends on the length of the list and how items in the list are stored.
